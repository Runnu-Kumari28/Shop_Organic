        <h3>Fresh and Non-GMO Products</h3>
        <p>
            Non-GMO (Non-Genetically Modified Organism) products come from sources that haven't had their genetic makeup altered in a lab using specific techniques. 
            This means they haven't received genes from other species or had their own genes manipulated in ways that wouldn't happen naturally.
